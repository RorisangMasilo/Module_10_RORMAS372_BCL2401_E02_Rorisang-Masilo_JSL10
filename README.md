# [JSL10] Submission: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

## Project Overview

The Escape Vanilla JS Challenge is an interactive web-based project focusing on debugging skills, problem-solving, and the concept of abstraction. You will navigate through three themed "rooms," each presenting a unique challenge that requires them to debug and correct given JavaScript code to proceed. This adventure is themed around escaping the confines of Vanilla JavaScript to advance towards learning React.

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Debugging Tasks (Development Objectives)

1. **Correct the ID used in the event listener for Room 1.**
2. **Use the correct element ID when displaying results for Room 1.**
3. **Add the missing 'async' keyword to the JS concepts set.**
4. **Correct the function call to find the intersection of `jsConcepts` and `reactConcepts` for Room 2.**
5. **Ensure asynchronous operations are handled correctly in Room 3, particularly by adding `await` before the promise in `navigateLabyrinth`.**
6. **Adjust the `findMostRecentBook` function to correctly compare dates and find the most recent book.**
7. **Fix the `findIntersection` function to correctly determine the intersection of two sets.**
8. **Add the `await` keyword before `new Promise` in `navigateLabyrinth` to ensure the simulation of asynchronous operations works as intended.**

## Reflections

### Areas of Mastery

Weekly, I see an improvement in my ability to read the code and briefly understand its outcome. And then have it verified by the provided solution.

### Challenges Encountered

To be honest, I have experienced a couple challenges in understanding the implementation and functionalities of code in certain areas such as the async, await, fetch functions.

### Areas of Improvement

Weekly, I have the desire to articulate the code and improve the time management behind my coding or problem-solving within a specific or requested time frame.

### Overall Learning Experience

My overall learning experience of this project is encapsulated in the topic mentioned above. Although, I must add that I have learnt how to improve the reading and validating of a code with thorough observation of each fuction, its implementation, functional purpose and overall project contribution.
